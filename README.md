pytest-testrail
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dubner/pytest-testrail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dubner/pytest-testrail)


This is a pytest plugin for creating testruns based on pytest markers.
The results of the collected tests will also be updated against the testrun in TestRail.

Installation
------------

    pip install pytest-testrail


Configuration
-------------

Add a marker to the tests that will be picked up to be added to the run.

	from pytest_testrail.plugin import testrail

	@testrail('C1234', 'C5678')
	def test_foo():
		# test code goes here

Settings file template cfg:

	[API]
	url = https://yoururl.testrail.net/
	email = user@email.com
	password = password

	[TESTRUN]
	assignedto_id = 1
	project_id = 1
	suite_id = 1

If you'd prefer to be using test runs, this is what your marker and setup would look like.

	from pytest_testrail.plugin import suite_testrail

	@suite_testrail('S123', 'C1234', 'C5678')
	def test_foo():
		# test code goes here

Settings file template cfg:

	[API]
	url = https://yoururl.testrail.net/
	email = user@email.com
	password = password

	[TESTRUN]
	assignedto_id = 1
	project_id = 1
	use_plan = 1

Usage
-----
	py.test --testrail=<settings file>.cfg

This will create a test run in TestRail, add all marked tests to run.
Once the all tests are finished they will be updated in TestRail.

	--tr_name='My Test Run'

Testruns can be named using the above flag, if this is not set a generated one will be used.
' Automation Run "timestamp" '

	--no-ssl-cert-check

This flag can be used prevent checking for a valid SSL certificate on TestRail host.
